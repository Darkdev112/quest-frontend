            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>
        <li>Choose not to drink too much yourself and help others not do it.</li>
          <li> <b>Set a drinking goal.</b>Set a limit on how much you will drink. You should keep your drinking below the recommended guidelines: no more than one standard drink per day for women and for men ages 65 and older, and no more than two standard drinks per day for men under 65. </li>
          <li><b>Put it in writing.</b> Making a list of the reasons to curtail your drinking — such as feeling healthier, sleeping better, or improving your relationships — can motivate you.</li>
          <li><b>Don't keep alcohol in your house.</b> Having no alcohol at home can help limit your drinking.</li>
          <li><b>Choose alcohol-free days.</b> Decide not to drink a day or two each week. You may want to abstain for a week or a month to see how you feel physically and emotionally without alcohol in your life. </li>
          <li><b>Watch for peer pressure. </b>Practice ways to say no politely. You do not have to drink just because others are, and you shouldn't feel obligated to accept every drink you're offered. </li>
          <li><b>Keep busy.</b> Take a walk, play sports, go out to eat, or catch a movie. </li>
          <li><b>Be persistent.</b> Most people who successfully cut down or stop drinking altogether do so only after several attempts. </li>

            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>
        <li><b>Set a strict time limt for daily plan.</b> If you’re worried about how much time you or your child spends gaming, start by limiting play to no more than 30 minutes each day. Set the alarm or ask a friend to send you a text to remind you it’s time to do something else.</li>
          <li> <b>Remove gaming Devices from your house</b>Having gaming devices in the house makes it too easy to play whenever you feel like it. In addition, playing before bedtime can result in poor-quality sleep. Keeping the bedroom screen-free will help you control your gaming time and help ensure you feel rested and energized in the morning. </li>
          <li><b>Ask friends and families for halep</b> Let your friends and family in your life know you’re concerned about developing a gaming addiction and are trying to cut back. If that seems too personal, just let people know you’re interested in doing more social activities.</li>
          <li><b>Try other stress-relieving activities</b>Gaming relieves stress for many people. Developing other coping strategies will make it easier to limit game time. Learn how to meditate or do yoga. Try working out or go for a challenging hike. Creative expression is also a stress-buster. Draw, paint, write, play music or enjoy any other screen-free hobby.</li>
          <li><b>Seek gaming addcition treatment</b> If you’ve tried the above suggestions and still find it difficult to control your behavior, you may need help from trained mental health professionals.  </li>

          <p className="box1p">
            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>

          <li> <b> Look for better alternatives.</b>The expert says, “Be mindful of the time you spend on social media. Recognise the purpose it serves for you, it might serve as a good source of distraction, a filler, or even a source of information.” Once you are aware of the input it is giving to you, you can go ahead to determine if other mechanisms can be brought into place that could help fulfil the objectives that social media is helping with.</li>
          <li><b>Cultivate more fruitful interests and hobbies.</b>Even if social media is helping you in good ways, spending unlimited time can do more harm than good. “If you wish to let go of this bad habit, work actively to develop areas of interest and hobbies that might help. Look to incorporate activities that aid in providing purpose and meaning to your routines and day”, suggests the expert.</li>
          <li><b>Try to harbour real interactions.</b>You might have found your safe space in interacting online, the truth is that nothing can parallel real interactions. The expert reckons to engage more actively with people around you, and never allow yourself to substitute real interactions with virtual ones.</li>
          <li><b>Set time limit.</b> Set time limits for hourly usage of social media, and use the support of others, if needed, to be able to implement the same. </li>
          <li><b> Don’t compare yourself to others </b>What works for someone else might not work for you when it comes to looking for ways to beat social media addiction. But don’t let that demotivate you. Work out what works best for you, and execute the same without comparing your growth with others.</li>

            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>
       
          <li> <b>Set goals.</b>Setting short-term and long-term goals may help you to stay focused and clear about cutting down or giving up gambling.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid high-risk situations .</b> Such as the use of credit cards, taking out loans, carrying large amounts of money with you, using gaming venues for socialising, or gambling as a reaction to emotions. These behaviours will weaken your resolve to control or stop your gambling.</li>
          <li><b>Talk about it.</b> Talking about gambling with somebody you trust and someone who won't judge you can ease the pain of bottling it up. It can also reduce the stress that can cause you to continue to gamble.</li>
          <li><b>Find alternatives to gambling.</b>  There are two major risk factors why people continue to gamble, social isolation and leisure substitution. When people stop gambling they lack motivation to find other activities that are exciting and fun and they lost family and friends who could support them in engaging in such activities. </li>
          <li><b>Watch for peer pressure. </b>Practice ways to say no politely. You do not have to gamble just because others are, and you shouldn't feel obligated to accept every drink you're offered. </li>

          <p className="box1p">
            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>
        
          <li> <b>Redefine success.</b>Start by rethinking how you define success. Workaholics tend to be perfectionists who are always aiming to get ahead. Professional achievements are well and good, of course, but to live a truly full life you also need to “have purpose and draw a boundary line that shows respect for your family life, physical health, and spiritual health,” says Friedman. </li>
          <li><b>Refocus your attention.</b>Next, you need to step back and reflect on how you want to spend your time and energy. “Think about what matters,” Friedman says. “As you’re trying to establish meaningful connections and advance your career, attention is your most precious asset.” How do you want to invest it? “You have a lot more control over those things than you think.” There will always be more work to be done, but make the conscious choice to spend time elsewhere: with family, with friends, or in your community.</li>
          <li><b>Reset expectations.</b> enlisting the help of colleagues, family, and friends for “accountability and support.” Resetting the expectations of your boss and coworkers requires that you be clear about the changes you’re making and why you’re making them. </li>
          <li><b>Experiment with digital detoxes.</b> You don’t have to be a work addict to be a slave to your smartphone . There’s no reason to keep your smartphone within reach after the workday is done.Stop using your phone as a time-filler.  </li>
          <li><b>Practice mindfulness. </b>A growing body of evidence suggests that practicing nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness — also known as mindfulness — helps people become more mentally flexible and make better decisions. </li>
          <li><b>Prioritize your health — for the sake of others.</b> As you shift priorities, also remember to take care of yourself. “You can’t work productively in a creative and nuanced way for more than a certain number of hours per day — and you certainly can’t do it without proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise,” says Blair-Loy.  </li>
          <li><b>Keep busy.</b> Let friends and family members know that you need their support</li>

          <p className="box1p">
            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>
       
          <li> <b>Self-awareness.</b>“Are you a person who is prone to over-doing things and who struggles with addiction in other areas of your life?” asks Heath. “If so, be aware of some of the warning signs and have someone who is holding you accountable. Know your why for beginning a fitness program.”</li>
          <li><b>Healthy coping strategies.</b> If you’re using exercise as a means of control or emotional coping, developing other healthy coping strategies may help. Exercise is good for mental health, but only up to a certain point. A therapist or counselor can help you learn other ways to manage stress and feel more in control of your own life.</li>
          <li><b>Therapy or counseling.</b> “If you or someone you love notices that you have begun to be inflexible regarding your work-outs, you are angry or agitated if you have to skip exercise, or you find that you work out even if you are injured, there is a high probability that you have crossed the line,” says Heath. “You may need to talk to a professional counselor specializing in exercise addiction to help you get back on track.”</li>
          <li><b>Takeaway.</b> Exercise addiction is a compulsion to exercise to exert some level of control over your life, health, or body — at the expense of your own best interests. Like other behavioral addictions, over time people with exercise addiction will need to exercise more and more and more to get the same sense of control or relief. </li>

            <p>Addiction may be strong enough but it's never too late to break free</p>
        
          <li> <b> Avoid Temptation and Peer Pressure.</b>It’s often said “we become most like those we surround ourselves by,” meaning if you surround yourself with people who abuse drugs and alcohol you are more likely to as well. Peer pressure is a major part of life for teens and adults. If you are looking to stay drug free develop a good way to just say no, prepare a good excuse or plan ahead of time to keep from giving into peer pressure.</li>
          <li><b> Seek help for mental illness.</b>Mental illness and substance abuse often go hand in hand. If you are dealing with a mental illness such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder you should seek professional help from a licensed therapist or counselor. A professional will provide you with healthy coping skills to alleviate your symptoms without turning to drugs and alcohol.</li>
          <li><b>Examine the risk factors.</b>  Look at your family history of mental illness and addiction, several studies have shown that this disease tends to run in the family, but can be prevented. The more you are aware of your biological, environmental and physical risk factors the more likely you are to overcome them. </li>
          <li><b> Keep a well-balanced life.</b> People often turn to drugs and alcohol when something in their life is missing or not working. Practicing stress management skills can help you overcome these life stressors and will help you live a balanced and healthy life.

Develop goals and dreams for your future. These will help you focus on what you want and help you realize that drugs and alcohol will simply get in the way and hinder you from achieving your goals. </li>

          <li><b>Avoid your triggers. </b>Don't linger over social media images of people with bodies that are unrealistic for you. Stay away from the scale and your mirror. If stress or boredom triggers binges, practice using healthier ways to deal with them.
